# cloud-deploy
The root README for the Cloud-Deploy project. The Cloud-Deploy project will initially cover Ruby/Chef scripts for direct IaaS/Paas deployments with Hyper-V and Linux. Once that task has been accomplished, this project will then cover OpenStack related source, and deployment scripts for OpenStack environments.
